                "When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to connect with the spirits of the dead. During a short or long rest, you can choose a creature that has died within the last 24 hours and spend 1 hour in meditation. At the end of the rest, you temporarily gain a fragment of the creature's spirit. This fragment grants you the benefits of one skill or tool proficiency the creature had in life. You retain this proficiency until you use this feature again to choose a different proficiency. If the creature had no such proficiency, you gain proficiency with one skill or tool of your choice.",
                "In addition, you can use your Sneak Attack with an attack even if you have advantage on the attack roll, but only if the attack doesn't have disadvantage due to an effect or feature of the target, and if you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll."

When a life ends in your presence, you can use your reaction to create a token from the creature's departing spirit. You can have a number of tokens equal to your proficiency bonus at one time. The token is a Tiny object and has no value. You can use these tokens to bolster your abilities.",
                "Whenever you make an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw, you can spend one of your tokens to roll an additional d6 and add the number rolled to your roll. You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to use the token, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. You can use only one token on a roll."

On a failed save, the creature takes 10d10 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its soul is torn from its body and is trapped in one of your tokens of the departed, provided you have one from that creature. The creature can only be restored to life by a true resurrection or similar magic, and only if its soul is released from the token."
